# Synthetic-Data-Analysis-Exploring-Regression-and-P-values
In this project, I worked with a synthetic dataset created by my professor to explore various regression techniques and assess model performance. The objective was to identify relationships between features and the target variable using the tools available to me, such as linear and polynomial regression, p-values, and basic statistical analysis. At the time, I hadn't yet learned advanced tools like PCA or LASSO, so my focus was primarily on understanding p-values and regression methods to uncover the underlying data structure. My professor's feedback indicated that I had correctly dropped the right variables and that my model was fairly accurate. Now, I'm focusing on more advanced and efficient techniques in my machine learning intro class.
